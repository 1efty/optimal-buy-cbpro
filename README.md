# optimal-buy-gdax

Scheduled buying of BTC, ETH, and LTC from GDAX optimally! Be your own index/hedge fund, and stop paying those greasy management fees.

# What is this?

This is a Python script you can use to automatically buy Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and Litecoin using the GDAX API. It buys these 3 currencies, weighted by market
cap (as reported by [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/)), using a form of [dollar cost averaging](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging). according
to the following logic:

1. Check current balances of USD, BTC, ETH, and LTC
1. If the USD balance is above $100, buy BTC, ETH, and LTC weighted by market cap
1. If there's enough USD available, place 5 discounted limit orders at the current price minus 0.5% up to 4.5%,
each order with 1/5th of the remaining amount to buy for each coin(see "[Details on the orders placed](#details-on-the-orders-placed)", below)
1. If there isn't enough USD available, place 1 buy order at 0.5% off the current price
1. If the USD account balance is below $100, withdraw coins to desired addresses

You can also use the same script to schedule deposits from your bank account
periodically, such as when you're paid.

Ideally, this script would help to make sure that when we dipâ€”

**we buy**.

# USE AT OWN RISK

Duh. Not my fault if you lose everything.

Unless you place **absolute trust** in me, some guy from the Internet, I suggest you clone the repo and build your own container to protect yourself from any sort of funny business.

# How do I use it?

1. Get yourself a hardware wallet, such as a [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [TREZOR](https://trezor.io/).
1. Set up a GDAX account, and link your bank account
1. Create the necessary API credentials for GDAX, with permissions to
manage funds, withdraw without 2FA, and trade
1. Determine the payment_method_id value by using the [GDAX API](https://docs.gdax.com/#payment-methods) (you can use your browser's developer toolbar, [here's a quick video showing how](https://youtu.be/NmSEBGbn7Mc))
1. Get a machine somewhere (GCE, EC2, Digital Ocean) with Docker and systemd
1. Copy systemd files over:

        $ sudo cp optimal-buy-gdax-*.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system
1. Edit [`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service`](optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service),
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer`](optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer),
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service`](optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service), and
[`/etc/systemd/system/optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer`](optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer) to your liking. Make sure you:

    * Change the BTC, ETH, and LTC deposit addresses to deposit the coins into your wallet (use a Ledger or TREZOR)
    * Put the correct API keys in
    * Check the deposit amount (start with something small, like $150, to make sure it actually works first)
    * Check the timer dates (it would be sensible to change the hh:mm so your script doesn't run the same time as everyone else's)

1. Enable the systemd units:

        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-buy.service
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.service
        $ sudo systemctl enable optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer

1. Start the systemd timers:
        $ sudo systemctl start optimal-buy-gdax-buy.timer
        $ sudo systemctl start optimal-buy-gdax-deposit.timer

1. Enjoy!

# Details on the orders placed

By default, there are 5 orders placed (for each currency) in steps of 1%,
starting at a 0.5% discount from the current price. To illustrate, if the
current price was $100 (per LTC, let's say), and you had $100 to buy,
the orders would look like this:

Order | Size      | Price
------|-----------|------
1 | 0.2010 LTC | $99.5
2 | 0.2030 LTC | $98.5
3 | 0.2051 LTC | $97.5
4 | 0.2072 LTC | $96.5
5 | 0.2094 LTC | $95.5

Furthermore, the amount of each currency to buy will be based on the current
market cap weighting of each coin. For example, at the time of writing the
weights are:

Coin | Market Cap (USD) | Weight
-----|------------------|-------
BTC | $195,824,365,435 | 0.791
ETH | $46,080,472,372	| 0.186
LTC | $5,592,776,540 | 0.023

So if your USD account had $1000 to invest, the amount invested in each would
become:

Coin | Weight | Amount Invested
-----|--------|----------------
BTC | 0.791 | $791
ETH | 0.186 | $186
LTC | 0.023 | $23

# Caveats/limitations

* Currently it only supports USD
* Some values are hardcoded, but if you want to change that feel free to send a
PR!
* If you try to trade manually or using some other bot at the same time,
you're probably going to have a bad time
* You might have a few dollars (<$100) sitting in your account at all times,
even when all orders have been filled
* It makes a best effort with minimal complexity to invest all of your USD,
but it may not be possible to fill all orders right away
* It may take a few days for the market to drop enough for the buys to fill
